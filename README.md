### Bugs Encountered During Development

### Testing Process

*Try to use an Aim, Methodology, Result layout. A user should be able to read the Testing document, carry out the same tests on the live site and get the same results.  Try testing the user stories comprehensively in terms of Features and Responsivity to get a better grade.  Include evaluation of bugs found and their fixes and explanation of any bugs that are left unfixed.  Test the UX thoroughly.*

### Bugs Encountered During Testing
